# Storemanager

It's my first Laravel project, the idea was to learn the framework by a "hands on" approach and also provide a tool to help the management of a friend's business. Pease check out https://backpackforlaravel.com/, it helped a lot to reduce the development time.

Features:
 - Login
 - Register
 - Supplies Management
 - Supplies Transactions
 - Product Management
 - Product Transactions
 - Stock Report
 - Balance Report

As a educational proporse project, please feel free to point out any wrongs or ways to improve the project, and also to use it in any way.
Project avaliable at http://acaidoatleta.herokuapp.com/

P.S.: Please ignore the the misspellings of some plural words, one of the packages that I used had problems with irregular plural nouns. Also, ignore the fact that there is only one repository class to manage all the models, it's ugly.

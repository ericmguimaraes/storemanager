# storemanager

It's my first Laravel project, the idea was to learn the framework by a "hands on" approach and also provide a tool to help the management of a friend's business. Pease check out https://backpackforlaravel.com/, it helped a lot to reduce the development time.

P.S.: I think it ended up a pretty organized project, but please ignore the the misspellings of some plural words, one of the packages that I used had problems with irregular plural nouns.
